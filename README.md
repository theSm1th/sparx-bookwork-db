# sparx-bookwork-db
I made this program to store bookwork codes digitally because I hate my school.

## Instructions

1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    Python is a required dependency if you plan to run the program without compiling. I choose not to distribuute compiled versions of this program as they tend to           trigger false alarms of AVs or etc due to AVX compression.

2. Clone the repo or download [main.py](https://github.com/theSm1th/sparx-bookwork-db/releases/download/v1.0.0/main.py).
3. Run it. It will create bookwork.json - this is where your bookwork codes are stored, so do not move them into seperate directories.
